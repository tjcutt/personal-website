      <h3 class="subTitle galvanizeAndBeyond">Galvanize and Beyond</h3>

      <p>
        With such a daunting task ahead, it is difficult to see what lies beyond Galvanize.
        The course will be trying yet rewarding, and my first goal is to make it through it while optimizing my time.
        That being said, no one came into this without a vision for the future.
        I envision a dynamic career that will continue to challenge me day after day.  There are a few things I dislike more than monotony.
        In the long run, my goal is to have the experience, confidence, and drive to work in a more free-lance setting that will allow flexibility in my schedule.
        Of course since this is all so new to me, I am reluctant to paint the future too vividly.  As I have seen in the past, life tends to surprise you in amazing ways.
        In the meantime, I am excitied, anxious, and nervous to start the program.
        I look forward to getting to know all of you and hope we can help each other grow and expand into our new careers.
      </p>
